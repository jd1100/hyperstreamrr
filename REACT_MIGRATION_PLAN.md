# HyperStreamrr React Migration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the complete migration of HyperStreamrr from vanilla HTML/JS to React while maintaining 100% functionality, UI design, and performance. The migration will be done incrementally to minimize risk and ensure zero downtime.

## Migration Strategy: Incremental Component Replacement

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
**Target: Establish React infrastructure without breaking existing functionality**

#### Task 1.1: Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Create new `src/` directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/           # React components
  ├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
  ├── contexts/            # React contexts
  ├── utils/               # Utility functions
  ├── styles/              # CSS modules/styled-components
  ├── types/               # TypeScript definitions (optional)
  └── legacy/              # Existing vanilla JS code
  ```
- [ ] Install React dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install react react-dom
  npm install --save-dev @vitejs/plugin-react vite
  ```

- [ ] Performance target: Same component render performance

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 5)
**Target: Enhance with React-specific optimizations while maintaining functionality**

#### Task 4.1: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement `React.memo()` for expensive components
- [ ] Use `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` for heavy computations

- [ ] Enhance accessibility (ARIA labels, screen reader support)
- [ ] Performance target: Same interaction speed with better UX

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Week 6)
**Target: Ensure complete functional parity and performance**

#### Task 5.1: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all React components
- [ ] Integration tests for P2P functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### React Architecture Decisions

#### 1. State Management Strategy
```javascript
// NetworkContext for global P2P state
const NetworkContext = createContext({
  networks: new Map(),
  activeNetwork: null,
  isConnected: false,
  peers: [],
  // Maintain exact same interface as current implementation
});

// Component-level state for UI
const useComponentState = () => {
  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);
  // Local component state only
};
```

#### 2. Pear Desktop Integration
```javascript
// Maintain Pear API access
const usePearIntegration = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Pear lifecycle hooks
    Pear.teardown(() => {
      // Cleanup P2P connections
    });
  }, []);
};
```

#### 3. Streaming Performance
```javascript
// Keep existing streaming logic wrapped in hooks
const useFileUpload = () => {
  const uploadFileStreaming = useCallback(
    // Exact same implementation as current
    async (file, filePath, progressCallback) => {
      // Maintain 2MB chunks, 3 parallel uploads
    },
    []
  );
};
```

### Performance Guarantees

#### 1. Bundle Size Targets
- **Current**: ~500KB total application size
- **Target**: <600KB with React (20% increase max)
- **Strategy**: Tree shaking, code splitting, minimal React build

#### 2. Runtime Performance Targets
- **Startup**: Current ~200ms → Target <250ms
- **File Upload**: Current speeds maintained exactly
- **Video Streaming**: Current MediaSource performance maintained
- **UI Interactions**: Current <16ms → Target <16ms (no regression)

#### 3. Memory Usage Targets
- **Baseline**: Current memory usage
- **Target**: 20% reduction through better state management
- **Streaming**: Same memory footprint for large files

### Risk Mitigation

#### 1. Incremental Migration Strategy
- Each phase can be rolled back independently
- Vanilla JS and React coexist during migration
- Zero downtime deployment approach

#### 2. Feature Parity Validation
- Automated testing for every feature
- Performance regression testing
